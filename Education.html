    <h2>Education</h2>
    
    <p>
      Albert Einstein's education was a mix of traditional schooling and self-directed learning. He initially attended Catholic elementary school and then Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich, where he found the rigid teaching style stifling. He later attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, where he focused on mathematics and physics, eventually earning a teaching diploma. Despite his brilliance, he faced challenges in the traditional academic system, but ultimately found success through his own intellectual pursuits.
