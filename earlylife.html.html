    <h2>Early Age</h2>
    
    <p>
      Albert Einstein was born on <strong>March 14, 1879</strong>, in the city of <strong>Ulm</strong>, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. He was the first child of Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. The family moved to <strong>Munich</strong> shortly after his birth, where his father and uncle founded an electrical equipment manufacturing company.

      As a young boy, Einstein showed signs of delayed speech development and was considered a quiet child. His parents were initially worried about his late development, but he displayed a remarkable curiosity about nature and the invisible forces around him.

      One of the defining moments of his childhood was receiving a <strong>magnetic compass</strong> at the age of five. He was fascinated by how the needle moved without any visible force. This sparked his interest in science and his desire to understand the natural world.

      Though Einstein didn’t enjoy the strict discipline of the German schooling system, he excelled in mathematics and had a deep interest in music, especially the violin, which he learned from his mother. His early education included attending the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich, where he received a more traditional education.

      In 1894, when his father’s business failed, the Einstein family moved to Italy. Albert stayed behind briefly to finish school but soon left to join his family in Milan. This move marked the beginning of his quest for academic freedom, eventually leading him to Switzerland and the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich.
